*** This repository contains code for google chrome extension *** : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-prodigy-autogpt-w/nlkdjiiffalhmoaconegckknmebklpfa?hl=en&authuser=0 

It provides AUTOGPT functionality for FREE on chat.openai.com. Unfortunately due to continuous UI changes made by openai, we are unable to maintain it. It contains few errors, if I can find few contributors, who can fix them, it would be a great contribution. Really looking forward on it!

Why is the extension asking for access to all websites permission?
üëâ The extension requires access to all websites when using AutoGPT and web access mode. We scrap search engines to get updated information which CHATGPT lacks.
